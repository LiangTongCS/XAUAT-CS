敦煌莫高窟 (Mogao Grottoes)数字展示中心于 2014 年开放启用，是莫高窟保护利用工程的重要组成部分。展示中心采用数字技术和多媒体展示手段，使游客进入洞窟参观之前就能了解莫高窟的历史文化，鉴赏莫高窟的艺术经典。这将减少开放洞窟的数量，缩短游客在洞窟内的逗留时间，减轻参观对莫高窟造成的影响，以使这一世界文化遗产得到妥善保护、长久利用。

The Digital Display Center of Mogao Grottoes, commissioned in 2014, is a key component of the Mogao Grottoes Conservation and Utilization Project. By leveraging digital technology and multimedia presentations, the center allows visitors to understand the historical and cultural significance of Mogao Grottoes and appreciate its artistic masterpieces before entering the caves. This approach reduces the number of caves open to the public, shortens visitors' time spent inside the caves, and minimizes the impact of tourism activities—ultimately protecting this world cultural heritage site and ensuring its sustainable preservation.


水墨画(ink wash painting)是一种毛笔画。基本水墨画只使用深浅不一的黑色墨水。唐朝时，水墨画得到发展。人们普遍认为是王维将颜色加入到当时的水墨画中。水墨画的目标不仅仅是复制物体的外观，还要捕捉它的灵魂。要想画一匹马，水墨画家必须了解马的肌肉和骨骼，更要了解马的气质(temperament)。要想画一朵花，水墨画家并不需要完全描摹它的花瓣和颜色，重要的是传达它的活力和芳香。

​​Ink wash painting​​, a form of brush painting, uses only black ink in varying concentrations. It developed during the Tang Dynasty. Wang Wei is widely credited with adding color to the ink wash paintings of his era. The goal of ink wash painting is not merely to duplicate an object's appearance but also to capture its essence. To paint a horse, the artist must understand not only its muscles and bones but also its temperament. To depict a flower, fully copying its petals and color is unnecessary; conveying its life and fragrance is essential.
